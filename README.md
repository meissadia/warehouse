# Warehouse

## Description
Warehouse is an inventory tracking system that makes finding your stuff easier!

## Motivation
I've been doing a ton of Spring cleaning and, while knee deep in unlabeled boxes, I figured I could use an easily accessible and searchable inventory of all this STUFF!  

This turned out to be a great project to build while following [TheNetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/TheNetNinja)'s course on GraphQL [(Linkage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q).  

It's been a valuable dive into working with Express, GraphQL schemas and mutations, and of course React and JS development.  

I'm also planning to finally try out Jest's snapshot testing! That should be cool. 

## Roadmap
• Add Search box for Inventory  
• Add Location dialog  
• Continue to build test suite

## Stack
Front-end is React/Apollo  
Back-end is Express/GraphQL  
CSS Grid (really digging `grid-template-areas` for ease of building a layout!)  

## Run Locally
```
We're using Node 10.15.1.
```  

After cloning the repo, open a terminal for each the `/client` and `/server` directories and run 
```
npm install
npm start
```
